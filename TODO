there is a nix flake for vscodium to manage exensions - look into that
managing firefox

make the config files editable

theming the desktop

theming guake

guake doesn't work properly on restart, it shouldn't shift down or auto-dropdown

familiarize oneself with the nix repl for testing things


come up with a proper system for theming using dconf, including separating theme and function

look into switching to librewolf

nix2dconf bug? maybe report

set up nix2dconf as a tool in this shell instead of a global package

extract out the startup system as a function to reuse

configure menu and calendar

firefox - bind inspector to the left, not the bottom
